Mama's talking us to zoo tomorrow
Zoo tomorrow

Mama's talking us to zoo tommorrow
We can stay all day
See the elephant with long trunk swingin"s
Great big ears and long thrunk swingin's
Sniffin' up peanuts with the long trunk swinging
we can stay all day.
We've been to the zoo,zoo.,zoo
SO have you, you, you
You came too, too, too
We've been to the Zoo,zoo,Zoo
But- Daddy's talking us to the zoo tomorrow
Zoo tomorrow
Zoo tomorrow
Daddy'd taking us to the zoo tomorrow
We can stay all day!
